Talkative# - An internal network chat programmed in MonoDevelop and C#

The main idea is to create a simple, cross-platform, secure chat.
We mean "secure" by being hard to track a conversation by sniffing the packets and hard to decrypt it.
This is achieved by using UDP sockets, rotating the listening port and adding encryption to every message.
